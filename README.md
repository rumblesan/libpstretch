# Wave Stretcher

A reimplementation of the [Paulstretch](https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_cpp) algorithm in pure C

## Description

I wanted to learn how the Paulstretch, extreme slowdown algorithm worked, and I wanted a CLI version of it for my own projects, so I wrote this.

Many thanks to [Paul Nasca](http://www.paulnasca.com/) for creating the original program and for pointing out some useful stuff to me.
