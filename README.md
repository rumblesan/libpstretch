# Lib PStretch

A reimplementation of the [Paulstretch](https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_cpp) algorithm in pure C

## Description

I want to use the Paul Stretch algorithm in other projects, so I'm turning it into a library.

Many thanks to [Paul Nasca](http://www.paulnasca.com/) for creating the original program and for pointing out some useful stuff to me.

## Docker

The docker image is to test building and installing on linux.

``` bash
docker build . -t libpstretch
```
